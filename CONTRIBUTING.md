## Add Yourself to AUTHORS.md

Before we can accept a PR, we need you to add yourself to the [AUTHORS.md] file,
along with a statement that you are willing to license your contributions under
the terms of the [Apache License, Version 2.0] (included in this repository in
the toplevel [LICENSE] file).

[Apache License, Version 2.0]: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
[LICENSE]: https://github.com/iqlusioninc/crates/blob/develop/LICENSE

To do this, edit the [AUTHORS.md] file, inserting your name in the list of
contributors (in rougly alphabetical order by last name, preferably) along with
the name of the crate or crates you are contributing to.

Commit the [AUTHORS.md] file alone (i.e. do not modify other files in the same
commit, although it is fine to include this commit as part of your first PR to
the project), and use the following commit message:

```
AUTHORS.md: adding [MY GITHUB USERNAME] and licensing my contributions

I, [LEGAL NAME HERE], hereby agree to license all contributions I make
to this project under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.
```

Please replace `[MY GITHUB USERNAME]` with the GitHub username you are sending
the PR from, including the `@` symbol (e.g. `@defunkt`), and also replacing
`[LEGAL NAME HERE]` with your full legal name.
[See this commit for an example](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/crates/commit/3f5e3d53c6960bd41e8b3832cea04ab47dae3cb9).

If you have concerns about including your legal name in this file but would
still like to contribute, please [contact us] and we can discuss other potential
arrangements.
