Custom derive support for [zeroize]: a crate for securely zeroing memory
while avoiding compiler optimizations.

This crate isn't intended to be used directly.
See [zeroize] crate for documentation.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Requires Rust **1.39** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied
with a minor version bump.

## License

**zeroize_derive** is distributed under the terms of either the MIT license
or the Apache License (Version 2.0), at your option.

See [LICENSE] (Apache License, Version 2.0) file in the `iqlusioninc/crates`
toplevel directory of this repository or [LICENSE-MIT] for details.
