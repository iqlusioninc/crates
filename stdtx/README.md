Extensible schema-driven [Cosmos] [StdTx] builder and [Amino] serializer.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

**stdtx.rs** is a Rust library for composing transactions in the [StdTx]
format used by several [Tendermint]-based networks.

It includes support for cryptographically signing transactions and serializing
them in the [Amino] encoding format.

Definitions of transaction types are easily extensible, and can be defined at
runtime by loading them from a TOML definition file. This allows
**stdtx.rs** to be used with any [Tendermint]-based software which
uses the [StdTx] format without requiring upstream modifications.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

- Rust **1.44+**
