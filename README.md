## Requirements

All crates require Rust 2018 edition and are tested on the following channels:

- `1.44.0` (minimum supported)
- `stable`

Crates may work on slightly earlier 2018 edition-supporting versions of Rust
(i.e. 1.31.0+) but are not tested on these releases or guaranteed to work.

All crates in CI with the above channels on the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows
