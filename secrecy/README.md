A simple secret-keeping library for Rust.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

**secrecy** is a *simple*, safe (i.e. `forbid(unsafe_code)` library which
provides wrapper types and traits for secret management in Rust, namely the
`Secret<T>` type for wrapping another value in a "secret cell" which attempts
to limit exposure (only available through a special `ExposeSecret` trait).

This helps to ensure secrets aren't accidentally copied, logged, or otherwise
exposed (as much as possible), and also ensures secrets are securely wiped
from memory when dropped.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.51** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied by
a minor version bump.

## serde support

Optional `serde` support for parsing owned secret values is available, gated
under the `serde` cargo feature.

It uses the `Deserialize` and `DeserializeOwned` traits to implement
deserializing secret types which also impl these traits.

This doesn't guarantee `serde` (or code providing input to `serde`) won't
accidentally make additional copies of the secret, but does the best it can
with what it is given and tries to minimize risk of exposure as much as
possible.
