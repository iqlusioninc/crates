Rust crate for encoding/decoding binary data to/from **base64** and **hex**
encodings while avoiding data-dependent branching/table lookups, and therefore
providing "best effort" constant-time operation.

Also includes a non-constant-time Bech32 encoder/decoder gated under the
`bech32-preview` Cargo feature (with a goal of eventually making it
constant-time).

Useful for encoding/decoding secret values such as cryptographic keys.

[Documentation]

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.47** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied by
a minor version bump.

## Security Notice

While this crate takes care to avoid data-dependent branching, that does not
actually make it "constant time", which is an architecture-dependent property.

This crate is a "best effort" attempt at providing a constant time encoding
library, however it presently provides no guarantees, nor has it been
independently audited for security vulnerabilities.

Use at your own risk.
