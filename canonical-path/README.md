`std::fs::Path` and `PathBuf`-like types for representing canonical
filesystem paths.

In the same way a `str` "guarantees" a `&[u8]` contains only valid UTF-8 data,
`CanonicalPath` and `CanonicalPathBuf` guarantee that the paths they represent
are canonical, or at least, were canonical at the time they were created.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.51** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied by
a minor version bump.
