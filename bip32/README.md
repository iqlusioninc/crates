BIP32 hierarchical key derivation implemented in a generic, `no_std`-friendly
manner. Supports deriving keys using the pure Rust `k256` crate or the
C library-backed `secp256k1` crate.

## About

BIP32 is an algorithm for generating a hierarchy of elliptic curve keys,
a.k.a. "wallets", from a single seed value. A related algorithm also
implemented by this crate, BIP39, provides a way to derive the seed value
from a set of 24-words from a preset list, a.k.a. a "mnemonic".

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.81** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied by
a minor version bump.
