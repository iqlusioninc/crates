Error context library with support for type-erased sources and backtraces,
targeting full support of all features on stable Rust, and with an eye towards
serializing runtime errors using `serde`.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

**anomaly.rs** draws inspiration from libraries like [`error-chain`],
[`failure`], and [`anyhow`] to provide the following features:

- An [`anomaly::Context`] type which impls [`std::error::Error`] including
  support for type-erased [`anomaly::BoxError`] sources. Contexts are generic
  around an error `Kind`, making the sources optional, and generally trying
  to strike a balance between typed errors and `Box`-based type erasure.
- Stringly typed errors using the [`anomaly::Message`] type, with a set
  of macros to construct these errors.
- Backtrace support using the [`backtrace`] crate, and with it support for
  stable Rust where other libraries might require nightly.
- Support for serializing errors using `serde`, allowing them to be submitted
  to exception reporting services and other structured logging systems.

Notably **anomaly.rs** does NOT include any sort of proc macro to define
its error `Kind` type. We recommend [`thiserror`] for that purpose.

## What makes anomaly.rs different?

[`anomaly::Context`] and its `Box`-ed wrapper, [`anomaly::Error`], are
generic around a concrete `Kind` type. Type erasure (based on
[`std::error::Error`]) is only used when constructing error chains:

- Concrete (generic) types for immediate errors
- Type erasure for error sources
- No additional traits beyond `std::error::Error`
- Stringly typed [`anomaly::Message`] for where enum variants are too
  cumbersome or error messages are coming from e.g. API responses.
- Structured logging of your errors using `serde`

## History

**anomaly.rs** is an extraction of a set of patterns and boilerplate
from real-world libraries and applications, most notably [Abscissa].

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.51** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied by
a minor version bump.
