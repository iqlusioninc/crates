Rust crate for encoding/decoding **Bech32** ([BIP-173]): a human-friendly base32
encoding for binary data intended for use with cryptographic keys.

[Documentation]

## What is Bech32?

**Bech32** is a human-friendly format for representing binary data, namely
cryptographic keys (public and private).

The format was designed to use a minimal set of alphanumeric characters which
have been selected to avoid accidental confusion, and also adds a checksum
across the encoded message, ensuring transcription errors are detected.

## What is iq-bech32?

**iq-bech32** has been designed to meet the rigorous challenges of handling
secret key material, minimizing intermediate buffers and ensuring any memory
containing potential key material is zeroed out on drop.

## Status

This crate is in a **beta**-quality state and is ready for experimental
usage. Our roadmap is as follows:

- [X] Zero out (using [clear_on_drop]) all intermediate buffers and state
- [X] Support for Bech32 separator characters other than `1`
- [ ] TODO: Constant-time encoding/decoding to prevent side-channel leakage
